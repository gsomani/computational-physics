Initially particle (gaussian wavepacket) is in the center of the box with momentum towards right. Positon uncertainity is low due to small width of gaussian but there is high momentum uncertainity. With time, it moves towards right and its position spread increases (and momentum uncertainity decreases) and then gets reflected from the box boundary. Since particle can't escape box there is no transmission and all energy is reflected back. Energy in each energy eigen state remains constant throughout the evolution. Higher energy modes travel faster than lower energy modes. Also, phase shift of pi occurs in reflected wave because of total reflection at rigid boundary. After reflection, particle momentum changes its direction and goes towards left. Collisions can be considered to be elastic because of total reflection (energy remains conserved) and momentum just reverses direction. Particle follows periodic motion with period being the period of lowest energy mode which equals h/E where E is energy of ground state.
