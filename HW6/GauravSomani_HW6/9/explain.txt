SOR converges significantly faster than Jacobi for optimum relaxation parameter used in SOR. SOR has L1 error less than 1e-8 after 100 iterations while Jacobi method does has higher L1 error(about 1e-3) even after 1000 iterations. Also, w=0.5 for SOR is slower than Gauss-Siedel,w=1.5 and optimum relaxation parameter SOR. Convergence rate of Jacobi is similar to w=0.5 in SOR. Gauss-Siedel is faster than that. Then,w=1.5 in SOR is faster than Gauss-Siedel and optimum relaxataion parameter (w = 2/(1+pi/J) which is about 1.85) is fastest.
