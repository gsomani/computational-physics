c) When z is very small, integral calculation using 100 point quadrature for the given length becomes incorrect. When z^2 is much larger than x^2+y^2 near the center of sheet, the function under integral does not chnage rapidly (also, it is not very large) and can be sufficiently fit with a polynomial of high degree and so integral calculation using gaussian quadrature works. But when z^2 is comparable or much smaller to x^2+y^2 near the center of sheet, function under integral varies rapidly and is very large. This is because distance(r) of mass from center of sheet becomes very small and so function under integral (1/r^3) becomes very large and highly dependent on position of point of sheet. So, integral calculation method should consider more points near center of sheet (x=y=0) for less errors in integral calculation. But quadrature with even number of points(along each axis) does not consider x=y=0 point. So, it underestimates integral near z=0. Similarly, quadrature with odd number of points(along each axis) considers x=y=0 point and overestimates integral near z=0 (also, there is is high error in distance calculation near center as it is very small near center denominator calu.
Solution to this is to increase number of points in quadrature. Since function is even in both x and y, only consider points in first quadrant for integral calculation and then quadraple it.
