Population dynamics of rabbits and foxes is periodic in nature. Number of rabbits is greater than foxes for most of the time. This is because if rabbits are less, population of foxes goes down due to low reproduction rate. Initially, rabbits and foxes are both 2 thousand in number. Due to low numer of rabbits, fox population decreases due to low reproduction rate. So, this decreasing fox population means higher survival chances of rabbits and hence rabbits start increasing. But this increase in rabbits, after some time, becomes significant. This helps starving foxes (by increasing food availability) and thus increase reprodcution rate and since already fox population is low, death rate is low. So, foxes start increasing again after reaching minumum of about 700. Increasing foxes, after some time, leads to fall in rabbit population after reaching maximum of about 7000. The foxes continue to increase until the rabbit population becomes equal to fox population (about 4300). Then fox population increase for a small amount of time after this so that difference becomes about 1000. Then they decrease,a bit faster than rabbits,along with the rabbits and become equal to rabbits (both being two thousand) and then cycle continues.
