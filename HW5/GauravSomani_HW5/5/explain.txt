b) Heavier canonball with same dimensions and initial velocity has higher range compared to lighter one. Drag force is independent of mass and only depends on object's shape and velocity. So, deceleration of object is inversely proportional to its mass. So, as mass increases, effect on drag on projectile motion decreases and projectile approaches ideal projectile motion (motion without air resistance). So, heavier mass travels further.
Initially, for some time, heavy and loght projectiles follow almost same trajectory. Then, after some time, lighter projectle slows down considerably due to dissipative air drag. Then, the trajectory of lighter projectile becomes lower than heavier one and it falls down earlier and closer.
