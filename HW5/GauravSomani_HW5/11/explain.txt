c) Large values at the end are not real. These are due to numerical errors adding up. When x is much larger than a, potential is very large compared to energy of particle. So, wavefunction is multiplied by large values of energy for numerical integraton of double derivative. So, errors in very small value of wavefunction (which is considerbaly prone to numerical precision errors) get amplified by a large amount when it is used for numerical integration of double derivative. This leads to large errors in derivative of wavefunction which leads to large errors in calculation of wavefunction and because of this feedback wavefunction blows up.
