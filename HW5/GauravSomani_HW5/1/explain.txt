b) RC represents the time constant of the circuit. It is the time taken by capacitor to charge or discharge. So, when RC is low, capacitor is able to charge quickly and follow the input voltage. So, output voltage is nearly equal to input voltage. But when RC becomes higher, capacitor is not able to charge fully upto input voltage maximum by the time input starts to fall. So, output volatge maximum is lower than input voltage maximum. So, output voltage is less sharp (slower) and also lesser in amplitude. This circuit is called low pass filter. The cut-off frequency for the circuit is 1/RC. The circuit allows frequencies below 1/RC and rejects above it. 
So, when RC=0.01 s, 1/RC = 100 Hz, it allows 1 Hz square wave (1 Hz square wave contains odd mutiples of 1 Hz (1 Hz, 3 Hz, 5 Hz, 7 Hz, 9 Hz, 11 Hz and so on). So, about first 50 harmonics are allowed (which is almost equal to perfect square wave) 
So, when RC=0.1 s, 1/RC = 10 Hz, it partially allows 1 Hz square wave with lower amplitude(1 Hz square wave contains odd mutiples of 1 Hz (1 Hz, 3 Hz, 5 Hz, 7 Hz, 9 Hz and so on). So, about first 5 harmonics are allowed which do not perfectly reconstruct square wave. 
So, when RC=1 s, 1/RC = 1 Hz, it converts 1 Hz square wave into 1Hz triangular wave with much lower amplitude(1 Hz square wave contains odd mutiples of 1 Hz (1 Hz, 3 Hz and so on). So, only 1 Hz sine wave is partially allowed and higher harmonics are even more diminished which just partially reconstructs triangular wave.
So, this shows it rejects ( or diminishes) higher frequencies and only allows frequencies below a cut-off frequency.
