d) Higher frequencies represent the small scale features (sharp features). So, sharpness of image (or deblurring) of image depends on the proper representation of high frequency components. Point spread function becomes very small (nearly zero) at high frequencies. To recover image, we divide each frequency component of blurred image by corresponding frequency component of point spread function. Higher frequencies are nearly absent (thats why it is blurred) in blurred image. So, this problem becomes a problem of finding 0/0 (very small/ very small) which is inderminate. Numerically, it can be seen that numerical errors are very high in these evaluations. Also, we can observe the unnatural ringing the image because of blowing up of high frequency components because of division by very low "high frequency" components of point spread function. This is due to very small values (nearly zero) of point spread function ( in frequency domain).
